	* include/tvmet/Vector.h (class Vector): enum  size removed, since it's never used
		here and not really usefull. Added new member function size() instead.

	* include/tvmet/Matrix.h (class Matrix): enum { rows, cols} removed since they are
		never used here, and not really usefull. Added new member functions
		rows() and cols() instead.

	* include/tvmet/Vector.h (class Vector): template argument length replaced
		with tvmet::Vector template argument Sz, since it's the same.
		Removed enum length, since isn't needed.

	* Makefile.am (rpm): --target=noarch added, therefore it's really
		plattform independed 8)
