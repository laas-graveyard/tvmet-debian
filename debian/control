Description: tvmet development package
 This Tiny Vector and Matrix template library uses Meta Templates (MT)
 and Expression Templates (ET) to evaluate results at compile time --
 which makes it fast for low order (tiny) systems.
"Tiny" is a subjective term, but typically means vectors and matrices
of size ten (10) or less.
