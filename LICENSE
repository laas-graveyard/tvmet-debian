tvmet License Agreement.


0. tvmet ("The Library") is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 2.1 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version, with the following additional conditions.
The following conditions take precedence over any conditions or restrictions
stipulated by the Lesser General Public License insofar as a conflict exists.

1. The tvmet License Agreement ("License") covers only tvmet ("The Library").
Other libraries which the Library may use are covered by their own respective
licenses.

2. Modification of the configure scripts, makefiles, or installation tools of
the Library to support a specific platform does not constitute creating a
modified or derivative work based on the Library.

3. Statically linking of a copy of the Library against any work using the
Library, i.e. the inclusion of (parts of) the Library into a program or binary,
is functionally equivalent to a work using the Library by linking to it
dynamically, and therefore does not constitute creating a modified or derivative
work based on the Library.

4. Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License.  Any executables containing that work also may be distributed under
the Lesser General Public License whether or not they are linked directly with
the Library itself.

5. Programs or binaries linked with the Library must be identified as such by
including, in the Documentation or by other means (for example in the About
Box or Online Help), the following statement:

"This software uses tvmet (http://tvmet.sourceforge.net)."
