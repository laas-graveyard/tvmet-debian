   A good library is never complete. Here are some points which I hope to cover
   in the future:

   -# more regression tests (bit operations are missing, not all functions and type
      promotion are tested) and examples (temporary the regression test can act
      as examples). The problems with the regression tests actually used is,
      that they does not follow mathematical, strong logical guide lines to cover all
      possible cases.
   -# write more examples, the regression test should not act as examples.
   -# better support for std::complex type.
   -# add functions like
      - matrix inverse using LUdecomposition and other matrix vector functions
      - meta functions for sin, cos etc.
   -# System V math support on linux seems to be incomplete
   -# better compiler support
   -# Interface to other numerical libraries as uBlas, BLAS, and LAPACK.


   Maybe, there will be a tvmet2. Some of the features mentioned above will
   require a redesign of tvmet. With this new design tvmet can better handle
   special matrices, like banded, symmetric or triangular matrices etc.
   Furthermore, sparse tiny vectors and matrices are easy to implement, as well
   as an allocator concept for re-sizable containers.

   The priority depends on the \ref projects as well as the support from the
   community - please support %tvmet.
