  \page benchmark Benchmark

  Prior to version 0.8.0, tvmet had benchmark results listed here. Benchmarking
  isn't as easy as had been thought. The compiler's optimizer is very tricky -
  even more than I am. 8( To outwit the optimizer takes time - I would rather
  put the time into tvmet, itself.

  Laurent Plagne has created some benchmarks using tvmet and other libraries,
  please have a look at
  <a href="http://www.opencascade.org/upload/87">opencascade</a>.

  The following benchmarks are done on my
  Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz
  Linux box:
  - \ref bench_axpy
  - \ref bench_matrix_matrix
  - \ref bench_matrix_vector
  - \ref bench_aat
  - \ref bench_ata

  using a patched version of BTL 20030124. The patch is necessary to be able
  to compile tvmet due to the high inline level used here. The patch is
  distributed with the package.
